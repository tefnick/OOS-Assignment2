# OOS-Assignment2
War Game 

/*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*/

Object Oriented Systems Fall 2017
Assignment 2: War
Due: Sunday Oct. 8th by midnight

DESCRIPTION:

In this assignment, you will design and build an object-oriented implementation of 3 variations of the card game, War.
The basic rules for the game are located here:
http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/
These are the rules for one variation of War. Your project must handle 3 variations of War:
a. placing won cards on the bottom of the playerâ€™s hand (you will need to have a maximum # of iterations because this game variation can last a ridiculously long time). Winner is player with most cards in hand at end of game.
b. placing won cards in a separate points pile. Winner is player with most cards in points pile at end of game.
c. 3-player war placing won cards in a separate points pile. The rules for 3-person war are located here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game). Winner is player with most cards in points pile at end of game.
Your design FOR ALL THREE implementations of War MUST USE POLYMORPHISM and share as must code as possible.
Your game implementations must log gameplay to the console, but please put the actual logging functionality in a separate class. All 3 variations should allow for the possibility of a tie and your output should indicate if a tie occurs.

Example 1 using a full deck:
Bob plays EIGHT of DIAMONDS as up card
Sue plays EIGHT of HEARTS as up card
War!
Bob plays FOUR of CLUBS as up card
Sue plays TWO of HEARTS as up card
Bob wins the round
Bob 6 vs Sue 0
Bob plays TWO of SPADES as up card
Sue plays SIX of HEARTS as up card
Sue wins the round
Bob 6 vs Sue 2 ...

Sue wins!
Example 2 using a deck with 2 cards of the same rank:
Bob plays EIGHT of HEARTS as up card
Sue plays EIGHT of CLUBS as up card
War!
Tie game!

Your code must follow all of the readability rules you used in Assignment 1, AS WELL AS:
a. your Java project must have AT LEAST 8 .java files (including Enums but excluding JUnit files)
b. no .java file may be more than 150 lines long (including blank lines and comments)
c. no .java file may be fewer than 3 lines long (including blank lines and comments)
d. error handling can only be accomplished using unchecked exceptions

You are required to create 10 JUnit test cases that test game variation outcomes WITH A FIXED DECK. This means that your card deck implementation must allow for the traditional 52 cards with a shuffle, as well as manually assigning it a set of known cards (e.g., a 2 card deck, a 3 card deck, a 4 card deck, etc.). If you know the order of the cards in the deck, then you know the expected outcome of the unit tests.


SUGGESTED APPROACH:
1. break out the functional requirements and data attributes
2. create a UML class diagram where you assign some of the functions and
attributes for just a few objects and draw relationships between the objects. 
start simple: with the cards and the deck
3. implement what you designed in #2
4. create some unit tests for what you did in #3
5. repeat #s 2 through 4 until you have a testable first variation of War
6. now design, build, and test a second variation but be sure to use polymorphism
and share code with the first variation
7. repeat until done


DELIVERABLES:
1. Name your Eclipse project CS4773Assignment2
2. Put a PNG or JPG copy of your UML diagram in your Eclipse project and call it
assignment2UML.png or .jpg
3. If you worked on a team, be sure to include a file called TEAM.TXT that has ALL
team member names and the total time in hours that it took you to complete this
assignment.
4. Export the entire project to a zip file called assignment2.zip and submit the
resulting zip file to Blackboard.

LATE POLICY:
-10 pts
RUBRIC
30 pts: All 3 variations of War execute and output required log messages 

30pts: Object-oriented design including use of polymorphism
and satisfies # of java files and file size requirements
and unchecked exceptions for error handling
20 pts: Code is readable
10 pts: UML class diagram
10 pts: At least 10 JUnit test cases and all pass
